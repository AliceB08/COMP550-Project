+ Build bag of words representation 
- Build a sequential representation
- Sentiment analysis feature  (*)
- use TFIDF
+ Logistic Regression 
- Play around with grid search on LR: best accuracy 55,9% (stemming, C: 0.1, max_df: 0.7, max_features: 150000, ngram_range: bigram). Still need to try out TFIDF
- Majority Genre (classifier that automatically assumes this is majority)
- Naive Bayes 
- LSTM
